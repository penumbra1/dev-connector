A social network for devs written in Node and React + Typescript.

My additions to the [original](https://github.com/bradtraversy/devconnector):


- Typescript (with Typegoose on the server)
- Built-in Mongoose validation + cleaner errors
- pnpm
- Custom tooling configs
- React Hooks
- Bootstrap → Semantic UI
- Gravatar → Cloudinary

More details: [server notes](server/NOTES.md).
